##NLP Checkpoint
This checkpoint focused on applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret data. The tasks centered around three key areas: dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering analysis with silhouette score interpretation, and creating insightful visualizations to illustrate results.

Using the provided dataset (sensor_data.csv), I implemented PCA to reduce the data's dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible. This step simplified the data and made it more manageable for subsequent analysis. Next, I performed clustering analysis to group similar data points, using metrics like silhouette scores to evaluate the quality and cohesion of the clusters.

The final step involved creating visualizations to display PCA-transformed data and clustering results effectively, enabling clearer insights into the data's structure. Completing this checkpoint reinforced my understanding of unsupervised learning techniques and their practical application, providing valuable experience in data analysis and interpretation.
